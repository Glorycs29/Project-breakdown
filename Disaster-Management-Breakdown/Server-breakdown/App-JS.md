This code sets up an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests, configure routes for interacting with a MongoDB database, and establish a connection to the database. It also enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and sets up the server to listen on a specified port. Let's break down the code and discuss its significance:

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Importing Dependencies**:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const connection = require('./db/conn');
   const cors = require('cors');
   const HospitalRoutes = require('./routes/HospitalRoutes');
   const RescueTeamRoutes = require('./routes/RescueTeamRoutes');
   ```
   - Imports the necessary dependencies: `express` for creating the server, `connection` for the database connection, `cors` for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and routes for defining API endpoints.

2. **Configuring Port**:
   ```javascript
   const port = process.env.PORT || 3001;
   ```
   - Defines the port on which the server will listen for incoming requests. It uses the environment variable `PORT` if available, or defaults to port 3001.

3. **Creating Express Application**:
   ```javascript
   const app = express();
   ```
   - Creates an instance of the Express application, which represents the server.

4. **Middleware Setup**:
   ```javascript
   app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' }));
   app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
   app.use(express.json());
   ```
   - Configures various middleware:
     - `cors`: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and restricts the allowed origins to `http://localhost:3000`.
     - `express.urlencoded`: Parses URL-encoded data and populates the `req.body` object.
     - `express.json`: Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and populates the `req.body` object.

5. **Using Routes**:
   ```javascript
   app.use('/hospital-data', HospitalRoutes);
   app.use('/rescue-team-data', RescueTeamRoutes);
   ```
   - Maps specific routes to corresponding routers, defining the base path for the respective routes.

6. **Starting the Server**:
   ```javascript
   app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server connected at port: ${port}`);
   });
   ```
   - Makes the server listen on the specified port and logs a message indicating successful server connection.

### Significance:

- **Express Server**: Initializes an Express server, providing the foundation for handling HTTP requests and defining routes.

- **Middleware Usage**: Utilizes middleware like `cors`, `express.urlencoded`, and `express.json` for request parsing and security enhancements.

- **Route Mapping**: Maps specific routes to their respective routers, allowing for organized handling of different API endpoints.

- **CORS Configuration**: Enables CORS with a specific origin, allowing cross-origin requests only from `http://localhost:3000`. This is crucial for securely interacting with the server from a different origin (e.g., a frontend application).

- **Port Configuration**: Allows flexibility by using the environment variable `PORT` or defaulting to port 3001.

- **Database Connection**: Assumes the existence of a `connection` module, suggesting that the server is expected to connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB) through this connection.

In summary, this code is important for setting up an Express server, configuring middleware for request handling and security, defining routes, enabling CORS for secure communication, specifying the listening port, and establishing a connection to a database. It forms the backbone of a server-side application, enabling interaction with clients and databases in a structured and secure manner.
